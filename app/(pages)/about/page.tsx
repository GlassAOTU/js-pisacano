          Kim Nguyen (Esq. of Counsel)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Kim is a licensed New York attorney, who is also admitted to practice in the Eastern and Southern Districts of U.S. Federal Court. 
          She attended Hunter College for her BA and Pace University for her JD. Kim’s practice ranges from Labor and Employment to brokering business sales, and everything in between. 
          She has extensive experience negotiating labor contracts. Her focus on Labor and Employment reaches from Federal and State agencies, like the National Labor Relations Board to private arbitration litigation. 
          Jokingly, Kim likes to say that she can help with everything except for personal injury and (contested) divorces. 
          Kim truly believes that legal and business knowledge should be available for those who want it; therefore, she has and continues to provide law-rate or pro bono legal counsel to individuals and organizations. 
          In addition to being an attorney, Kim is a real estate broker, NYS notary, and an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church (thanks to the internet).
